# BrainSuite Diffusion Pipeline (BDP)

BDP enables fusion of diffusion and structural MRI information for advanced
image and connectivity analysis. It provides various methods for distortion
correction, co-registration, diffusion modeling (DTI and ODF) and basic ROI-wise
statistic. BDP is flexible and diverse tool which supports wide variety of
diffusion datasets. For more information and detailed documentation, please
see BDP website: http://brainsuite.org/processing/diffusion/

This is version 23a (build #2307) of BDP, released on 17-Jul-2023.

Created by Chitresh Bhushan, Divya Varadarajan, Justin P. Haldar,
           Anand A. Joshi,  David W. Shattuck, and Richard M. Leahy



# Downloading BDP

Latest pre-compiled binaries and source code of BDP can be obtained from http://brainsuite.org/ .



# Compiling BDP

BDP is written in a combination of MATLAB, C, and C++ code. So, there two steps
in compilation process: (1) compiling c/mex files, and (2) compiling MATLAB code
to generate executables and packages. Both steps are performed from MATLAB
command prompt.

BDP requires working installations of following for building the binaries:
   - MATLAB 2023a: http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/
   - Image Processing Toolbox: http://www.mathworks.com/products/image/
   - MATLAB Compiler: http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/
   - A supported C/C++ Compiler: https://www.mathworks.com/support/requirements/supported-compilers.html

First open MATLAB and navigate to the `<BDP>/packaging_tools` folder of the
source code. Then, Compile the c/mex files by running following on the MATLAB
command prompt:

>> CompileBDPMexFiles

It will compile all required mex functions. Note that you should change the
generated Makefile in Linux and Mac to use clang instead of gcc.

Finally, compile the MATLAB code and generate packages by running following:

>> CompileBrainSuiteDiffusionPipeline --package 99aRC9 --build 9999

where, `99aRC9` is the name of release and `9999` is four digit build number.
This will generate relevant tarball/zip for distribution. Note that above step
requires `mcc` command from MATLAB Compiler toolbox.
