the SPM toolboxes. It should allow MATLAB users and developers to integrate
the CIFTI file format in their analysis pipelines, using the data and tools
of the Human Connectome Project (HCP).

See http://www.humanconnectome.org for details on the HCP.

See http://www.nitrc.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=1955 for details on CIFTI.
