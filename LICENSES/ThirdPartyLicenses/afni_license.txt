                         GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                            Version 2, June 1991

  Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 675 Mass
  Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. Everyone is permitted to copy and
  distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it
  is not allowed.

                                Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
  This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
  Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit
  to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
  covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can
  apply it to your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
  price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
  charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code
  or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
  use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do
  these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
  rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
  you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
  that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get
  the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know
  their rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
  and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
  copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
  software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,
  we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the
  original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect
  on the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
  patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making
  the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that
  any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed
  at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.

                       GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
  under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program",
  below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the
  Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
  translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
  included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each
  licensee is addressed as "you".

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
  Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
  the Program (independent of having been made by running the
  Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
  this License along with the Program.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for
  a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

  b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
  whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
  thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
  under the terms of this License.

  c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
  when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
  interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
  announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
  that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
  warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
  conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
  normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
  is not required to print an announcement.)

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work
  based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the
  terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend
  to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of
  who wrote it.

  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
  contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
  intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
  derivative or collective works based on the Program.

  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
  Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a
  volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
  work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
  of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
  following:

  a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
  source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
  and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
  or,

  b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
  years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
  of physically performing source distribution, a complete
  machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
  distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
  customarily used for software interchange; or,

  c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
  distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
  only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
  program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
  accord with Subsection b above.)

  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
  control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as
  a special exception, the source code distributed need not include
  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
  itself accompanies the executable.

  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
  except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
  License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from
  you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
  long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
  to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
  herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
  parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
  not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
  this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
  consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example,
  if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of
  the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
  through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
  License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
  Program.

  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
  under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
  intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in
  other circumstances.

  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
  implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
  willing to distribute software through any other system and a
  licensee cannot impose that choice.

  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
  to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
  the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
  License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
  excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in
  or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License
  incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
  License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
  versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
  differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
  Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to
  it and "any later version", you have the option of following the
  terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version
  published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not
  specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version
  ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
  author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by
  the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;
  we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided
  by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of
  our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software
  generally.

                              NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
  THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
  PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
  DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
  CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
  PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
  SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                           Version 1.0, July 14, 1998.

     This document outlines the principles underlying the OpenContent
     (OC) movement and may be redistributed provided it remains
     unaltered. For legal purposes, this document is the license under
     which OpenContent is made available for use.

     LICENSE

     Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distributing, and Modifying

     Items other than copying, distributing, and modifying the Content
     with which this license was distributed (such as using, etc.) are
     outside the scope of this license.

     1. You may copy and distribute exact replicas of the OpenContent
     (OC) as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the OC a copy of this
     License along with the OC. You may at your option charge a fee for
     the media and/or handling involved in creating a unique copy of the
     OC for use offline, you may at your option offer instructional
     support for the OC in exchange for a fee, or you may at your option
     offer warranty in exchange for a fee. You may not charge a fee for
     the OC itself. You may not charge a fee for the sole service of
     providing access to and/or use of the OC via a network (e.g. the
     Internet), whether it be via the world wide web, FTP, or any other
     method.

     2. You may modify your copy or copies of the OpenContent or any
     portion of it, thus forming works based on the Content, and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

     a) You must cause the modified content to carry prominent notices
     stating that you changed it, the exact nature and content of the
     changes, and the date of any change.

     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
     whole or in part contains or is derived from the OC or any part
     thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
     parties under the terms of this License, unless otherwise permitted
     under applicable Fair Use law.

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the OC, and
     can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
     themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
     sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
     distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work
     based on the OC, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
     of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
     the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who
     wrote it. Exceptions are made to this requirement to release
     modified works free of charge under this license only in compliance
     with Fair Use law where applicable.

     3. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to copy,
     distribute or modify the OC. These actions are prohibited by law if
     you do not accept this License. Therefore, by distributing or
     translating the OC, or by deriving works herefrom, you indicate
     your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and
     conditions for copying, distributing or translating the OC.

     NO WARRANTY

     4. BECAUSE THE OPENCONTENT (OC) IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE
     IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE OC, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
     AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE OC "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
     KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
     THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
     PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK OF USE OF THE OC IS WITH YOU.
     SHOULD THE OC PROVE FAULTY, INACCURATE, OR OTHERWISE UNACCEPTABLE
     YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

     5. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MIRROR AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE OC AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO
     YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
     THE OC, EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
     POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
