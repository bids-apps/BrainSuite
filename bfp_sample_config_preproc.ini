;;; fMRI preprocessing options.
; 1: T1 native space will be used for T1 preprocessing. 0: T1 will resample images to 1mm isotropic for preprocessing

; 1: Use FSL's rigid registration during processing, 0: BrainSuite's BDP rigid registration
FSLRigid=0

; T1 mask will be used to threshold fMRI data. May be useful for data with high signal dropout

; A reference volume is used for coregistration and motion correction. You may choose which method is applied to create your reference volume 1: Volumes with high SSIM to the middle volume are averaged together 0: All volumes are averaged together

; 0: Do not scrub data. Keeps original time series data.
; 1: Searches fMRI data for motion outliers after motion correction is applied. Uses FSL's fsl_motion_outliers using RMS intensity difference to reference volume a metric. Timepoints with difference measures above the set threshold are removed from time series.
